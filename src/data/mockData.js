  "Your playlist is so basic, even Starbucks baristas think you need more variety. 80% sad songs and the rest is just Taylor Swift on repeat? Someone needs a hug... and better music taste. 🔥",
  "Ah yes, the classic 'I peaked in 2015' music taste. Your top artists look like a time capsule from when you still thought skinny jeans were cool. Time to update both your wardrobe AND your playlist! 😂",
  "Your Spotify Wrapped was basically a cry for help. 47 hours of the same sad indie songs? Even the algorithm is worried about you. Maybe try something upbeat for once? 💀",
  "Looking at your music taste, I can tell you're the type to say 'I listen to everything' but it's really just the same 5 artists on shuffle. Your 'eclectic taste' is about as diverse as a vanilla ice cream shop. 🎵",
  "Your recently played is giving 'I'm going through something but won't talk about it in therapy'. Those 3am listening sessions aren't healthy, bestie. But hey, at least your algorithms know you better than your friends do! 🌙",
  "Ah, I see you've discovered the same 10 songs everyone else listens to. Congratulations on your original taste! Nothing says 'unique personality' like having the exact same Top 10 as 50 million other people. 🐑"
